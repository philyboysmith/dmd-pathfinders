                <h3>What is Duchenne muscular dystrophy?</h3>
                <p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration
                    and weakness. It is one of nine types of&nbsp;
                    <em>muscular dystrophy</em>.</p>
                <p>DMD is caused by an absence of&nbsp;
                    <em>dystrophin</em>, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. Symptom onset is in early childhood,
                    usually between ages 3 and 5. The disease primarily affects boys, but in rare cases it can affect girls.</p>
                <h3>What are the symptoms of DMD?</h3>
                <p>Muscle weakness can begin as early as age 3, first affecting the muscles of the hips, pelvic area, thighs
                    and shoulders, and later the skeletal (voluntary) muscles in the arms, legs and trunk. The calves often
                    are enlarged. By the early teens, the heart and respiratory muscles also are affected. For more about
                    DMD symptoms, see&nbsp;

                <p>
                    <a href="/disease/becker-muscular-dystrophy" target="_self">Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD)</a>&nbsp;is a milder version of DMD. Its onset is usually in the teens
                    or early adulthood, and the course is slower and less predictable than that of DMD.</p>
                <h3>What causes DMD?</h3>
                <p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy was first described by the French neurologist Guillaume Benjamin Amand Duchenne
                    in the 1860s, but until the 1980s, little was known about the cause of any kind of muscular dystrophy.
                    In 1986, MDA-supported researchers identified a particular gene on the X chromosome that, when flawed
                    (mutated), leads to DMD. In 1987, the protein associated with this gene was identified and named&nbsp;
                    <em>dystrophin</em>. Lack of the dystrophin protein in muscle cells causes them to be fragile and easily
                    damaged.</p>
                <p>DMD has an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern and is passed on by the mother, who is referred to as a
                    <em>carrier</em>. For more about the way gene mutations cause Duchenne dystrophy, see&nbsp;
                    <a href="/disease/duchenne-muscular-dystrophy/causes-inheritance" target="_self">Causes/Inheritance</a>.</p>
                <h3>What are DMD 'carriers'?</h3>
                <p>DMD carriers are females who have a normal dystrophin gene on one X chromosome and an abnormal dystrophin
                    gene on the other X chromosome. Most carriers of DMD do not themselves have signs and symptoms of the
                    disease, but a minority do. Symptoms can range from mild skeletal muscle weakness or cardiac involvement
                    to severe weakness or cardiac effects and can begin in childhood or adulthood. For more, read&nbsp;

                <h3>What is the life expectancy in DMD?</h3>
                <p>Until relatively recently, boys with DMD usually did not survive much beyond their teen years. Thanks to
                    advances in cardiac and respiratory care, life expectancy is increasing and many young adults with DMD
                    attend college, have careers, get married and have children. Survival into the early 30s is becoming
                    more common, and there are cases of men living into their 40s and 50s. For more about living with DMD,

                <h3>What is the status of DMD research?</h3>
                <p>MDA-supported researchers are actively pursuing several exciting strategies in DMD, such as&nbsp;
                    <em>gene therapy</em>,&nbsp;
                    <em>exon skipping</em>,&nbsp;
                    <em>stop codon read-through</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
                    <em>gene repair</em>. Human clinical trials are under way for some of these strategies. For an overview of
                    DMD research strategies and the latest research news, see&nbsp;

                <p>On Sept. 19, 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to eteplirsen (brand
                    name Exondys 51) as the first disease-modifying drug for DMD. For more, see

                <p>The FDA on Feb. 9, 2017, approved deflazacort (brand name Emflaza) to treat DMD. For more, see
